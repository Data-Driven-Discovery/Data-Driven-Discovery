# The Journey From Data to Insights

In this era of digital transformation, significantly influenced by the fourth industrial revolution, data is the critical fuel that powers business decision-making and strategy building. In the terrain of data, the journey from raw data to useful insights is not always easy. However, with the right set of skills, tools and techniques, one can seamlessly transform raw data into actionable insights.

The purpose of this article is to guide you through the stages of data processing and to equip you with fundamental skills such as data cleaning, data engineering, feature extraction, data modelling, and others, using machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn, pandas, Matplotlib etc.

## Understanding the Data Journey

The journey from raw data to insight can be divided into six key phases:
1. Data Sourcing
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Engineering
4. Feature Extraction
5. Data Modelling
6. Making Predictions and Drawing Insights

Let's dive a bit deeper into each stage.

### Data Sourcing

This is the initial stage where we collect raw data. The data may be collected from various sources such as databases, APIs, spreadsheets, etc. Let's create a simple pandas DataFrame to demonstrate the following steps in the data processing journey.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating simple dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {'Name': ['Anna', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Daniel', 'Elle'],
     'Age': [23, 45, 33, 55, 27],
     'Salary': [70000, 80000, 120000, 65000, 85000]})
df
```

Output:

```
    Name   Age   Salary
0   Anna   23    70000
1   Bob    45    80000
2   Charlie 33   120000
3   Daniel 55    65000
4   Elle   27    85000
```

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, incorrect data, and other issues that might hinder data analysis. Although our initial data is clean and without issues, you would usually use such functions as `df.dropna()`, `df.fillna()`, `df.replace()` in this stage.

### Data Engineering

In this phase, we may perform tasks such as one-hot encoding, binning, normalization etc. For our simple dataset we might want to bin the 'Age' into categories.

```python
bins = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
labels = ['20-30', '30-40', '40-50', '50-60']
df['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(df['Age'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)
df
```
Output:

```
    Name   Age   Salary AgeGroup
0   Anna   23    70000  20-30
1   Bob    45    80000  40-50
2   Charlie 33   120000 30-40
3   Daniel 55    65000  50-60
4   Elle   27    85000  20-30
```

### Feature Extraction

Depending on our study, it might be necessary to create new features from the available ones. For instance, if we had more detailed salary data, we could derive 'hourly rate', 'overtime pay', etc.

### Data Modelling

Data modelling is where we apply machine learning algorithms to make predictions or to derive insights. Scikit-Learn is one of the most widely used libraries for machine learning.

Although our data is not suitable for machine learning modelling, I'll provide an example of how you'd usually train a linear regression model:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = df[['Age']] # using age to predict salary 
y = df['Salary']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Drawing Insights

This is the final stage where we interpret our model's results and convert our findings into actionable business insights. With the trained model, we can predict the salary based on age.

## Conclusion

The journey from data to insight involves a series of steps from data sourcing to drawing insights. Each stage requires a certain skillset and numerous tools which can aid in smoothly sailing through these stages. Understanding the entirety of this journey is crucial for data professionals, as they navigate through the vast oceans of data towards valuable insights.
