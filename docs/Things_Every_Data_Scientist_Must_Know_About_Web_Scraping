# Things Every Data Scientist Must Know About Web Scraping

In the world of data science, web scraping is a tool you must be equipped with. It's an all-important part of data gathering and pre-processing. This article aims to reveal the secrets about `web scraping` that every data scientist must know. We shall delve into the basics of web scraping, why it's necessary, and how to implement it using Python.

## Introduction

Web scraping is a method of extracting and storing data into your local machine or database from a particular web page. It's mostly about automating the process of data extraction, hence, it saves enormous amounts of time and effort.

Data scientists and engineers use web scraping to collect data for research, analysis, content aggregation, sentiment analysis, and much more. There's a wealth of information on the internet just ripe for the picking and web scraping is your conduit to this ocean of data.

## The Basics of Web Scraping

There are a few things you need to know before diving into web scraping:

- Ethics: Web scraping should be conducted in a manner that doesn't harm the website or violate its terms of use. Respect should be employed when scraping and it's advisable not to inundate the server with too many requests per second.
- Knowing HTML and CSS: Understanding the HTML and CSS structure of a webpage will be helpful in order to effectively navigate and parse the page.
- Web Scraping Libraries: Various libraries in Python will assist you with web scraping such as `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, and `Selenium`.

## Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

To illustrate the implementation, we'll use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` packages from Python. Let's scrape data from a hypothetical website `http://example.com`. Below is a simple code to retrieve the HTML of the page.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "http://example.com"

r = requests.get(url)
print(r.content)
```
Output:
```bash
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ...
    <html>
        ...
        <body>
         ...
        </body>
     ...
     </html>
```

To explain, `requests.get()` is used to access the webpage and `.content` is used to retrieve the HTML content of the page.

Let's parse this HTML using `BeautifulSoup`.

```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')
print(soup.prettify())
```

The `BeautifulSoup` function creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and more readable manner. Here, we're parsing the HTML using Pythonâ€™s built-in HTML parser.

## Extracting Data

Identifying the data you need to scrape involves understanding the HTML structure of the webpage. Let's pretend we want to extract all text within paragraph tags. Here's how to do it:

```python
paragraphs = soup.find_all('p') 
for paragraph in paragraphs:
    print(paragraph.text)
```

The `.find_all()` function is used to find the all html tags that encapsulate the required data.

## Putting It All Together 

Adding the above components together, we get the following end-to-end web scraping code:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "http://example.com"

r = requests.get(url)
 
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')

paragraphs = soup.find_all('p') 
for paragraph in paragraphs:
    print(paragraph.text)
```

With just a few lines of code, we have written a simple web scraper that extracts paragraph texts from a webpage.

## Caution About Web Scraping

Web scraping pushes the boundaries of data privacy and legality. Always make sure the website terms allow web scraping before proceeding. Improper use can lead to IP bans or legal trouble. 

## Conclusion

Web scraping is a fundamental skill that every data scientist should be equipped with. It is an indispensable part of the data gathering and preprocessing stage. Python provides several powerful libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium that make it a breeze. Happy web scraping!

Remember, as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. Respect content creators and site owners by scraping responsibly.
