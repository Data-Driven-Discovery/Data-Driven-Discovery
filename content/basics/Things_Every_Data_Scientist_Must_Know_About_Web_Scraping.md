# Things Every Data Scientist Must Know About Web Scraping

Web scraping is an essential skill in the data scientist's arsenal. It involves the extraction of data from webpages. This information often helps in understanding and predicting trends, making it an indispensable tool in the world of data science. In this article, we will dive into what web scraping entails, Python's tools available for web scraping, and key considerations to understand during the process.

## Introduction

Web scraping is a potent technique to collect data from web pages. This process can be automated to search and extract large amounts of data quickly. Typically, a program sends a GET request to the targeted webpage's server, gets the server's response in HTML format, parses this HTML document, and extracts the required information.

Web scraping is instrumental in the fields of data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and several others, where huge sets of data are to be processed.

## Web Scraping with Python 

Python stands out in web scraping field due to its simplicity and availability of tools. Key Python libraries for web scraping include `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Scrapy`.

### **`requests`**

`requests` make use of HTTP to communicate with websites just like your web browser. To illustrate this, let's scrape the homepage of 'example.com':

```python
import requests

URL = 'http://www.example.com'

res = requests.get(URL)
print(res.text)
```

**Output**
```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
    ...

<article>
    <h1>Example Domain</h1>
    ...
</article>
</html>
```

### **`BeautifulSoup`**

Although `requests` are great for sending HTTP requests, they require a lot of work for parsing the HTML response. Here is where `BeautifulSoup` comes in handy - it handles all the complexities of parsing for you! Here's an example:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Continuing from the previous snippet
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract the title of the page
print(soup.title)

# Extract the text of the title
print(soup.title.string)
```

**Output**

```Text
<title>Example Domain</title>
Example Domain
```

### **Scrapy** 

Scrapy is not just a library but a complete web scraping framework, allowing you to write spider programs to crawl in websites and extract data. It's potent and efficient, however, it's more complex to get started:

```python
import scrapy

class ExampleSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'example'
    start_urls = ['http://www.example.com']

    def parse(self, response):
        print(response.css('title::text').get())
```

**NB**: Running this script requires the Scrapy command line interface, not just simple Python execution.

## Legal and ethical considerations

Web scraping could unintentionally lead to legal problems. Here are certain key considerations:
- Always read a website's "Robots.txt" file and "Terms of Service" before scraping. These provide guidelines about what they allow to be scraped.
- Try to make your scraping activities as less intrusive as possible so as not to cause any harm to the website. Alter the headers of your requests, limit the rate of your requests, etc.
- Never use scraped data for commercial purposes without permission. 

## Conclusion 

Web scraping is undoubtedly a powerful tool for any data scientist. Python, armed with libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` and `Scrapy`, makes the task easier. However, with great power, comes great responsibility - always remember the ethical considerations when undertaking a web scraping project.

With web scraping being integral to data collection and thus, the further stages of data processing and machine learning, mastering it is essential for a data science career. Happy scraping!
