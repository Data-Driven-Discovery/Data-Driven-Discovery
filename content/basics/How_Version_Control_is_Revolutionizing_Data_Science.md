# How Version Control is Revolutionizing Data Science

Introduction:

Data Science is an exciting field that is rapidly evolving, and the ability to manage the evolution of projects has become equally crucial. This is where version control comes into play.

Today, we discuss version control- a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It makes collaboration easier among teams and contributes significantly to the robustness and reproducibility of Data Science projects.

But first, let's understand why it's a game-changer!

## Why Version Control?

Consider your project folder after successive versions of data cleaning, model building, and improvements. Keeping track of these changes can become complex, and often, the only way to revisit a previous version would be to undo changes manually. Not only is this ineffective but also error-prone. With version control, you can navigate through different project versions seamlessly, making collating and managing changes effortless.

## Version Control Popular in Data Science

When we say version control, two striking names come in mind: Git and DVC. Git is a distributed version control system primarily used for source code management. DVC (Data Version Control) is built on top of git and is used for versioning large datasets and ML models.

## Version Control with Git

Using Git, it's easy to maintain different versions of your code. Below is a bash code snippet of initializing a Git repository, adding files to the repository, and committing the changes:

```bash
# initialize a Git repository
git init
# add a code file to the repository
git add script.py
# commit the changes
git commit -m "First commit"
```
This will initialize a Git repository in the current directory, add script.py to it, and commit the changes with a message "First commit".

## Version Control with DVC

Contrarily, DVC is designed to handle large data files, binary files, and ML models. It is an open-source tool that leverages a version control system designed for machine learning projects. Its syntax is quite similar to Git. Here is a sample python code showing how to initialize a DVC:

```bash
# initialize a DVC repository
dvc init
# add a large data file to DVC
dvc add data.csv
# commit the changes
git add data.csv.dvc .dvc/config .gitignore
git commit -m "First DVC commit"
```
The above code initializes a DVC repository to track the large file data.csv and commits the changes.

## Illustrating with an example

Let's look at a basic example of how one might leverage Git and DVC in a Machine Learning Project.

```python
# import required packages
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# load the iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

# split the data into train and test datasets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, 
                                                    test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
                                                    
# initialize a Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=2, random_state=42)

# fit the model
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# save the model
joblib.dump(rf_model, 'model.joblib')
```
Assuming you have already initialised Git and DVC repositories, the next step would be to add and commit the changes.

```bash
# add and commit code file
git add script.py
git commit -m "Added model training script"

# track the model using DVC
dvc add model.joblib
git add model.joblib.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "Tracked model with DVC"
```

Now, each time you make changes to your script (e.g., adjust hyperparameters) and train a new model, Git and DVC will help to maintain a clean and complete historical record of your project's evolution.

## Conclusion

Version control systems like Git and DVC are revolutionizing the way we handle Data Science and Machine Learning projects, making them more reproducible and collaborative. DVC further bridges the gap between Data Science and software development practices, bringing about a robust methodology to tracking data and model versions. It's high time we leverage these tools to bring order and efficiency to our Data Science pursuits. 

From managing project versions to aiding collaborations, version control is indeed one of the most important things a data science professional needs to master. In this ever-changing field, it's certain that whoever controls the versions, controls the game!
