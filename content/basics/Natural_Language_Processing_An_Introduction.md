# Natural Language Processing: An Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as one of the most significant subfields in machine learning and data science. From auto-correct features in smartphones to voice-assistants like Alexa and Siri understanding and even predicting our speech patterns, NLP applications are relentlessly interweaved into our everyday lives. In this blog, we will venture into the world of NLP, illustrating its applications, techniques, and how it revolutionizes the way we interact with machines.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing refers to the aspect of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with human language. It involves machine understanding, analysis, manipulation, and potentially generation of human language. Essentially, NLP makes possible a seamless interaction between humans and machines through natural language rather than coded language.

Let's commence our journey on this intriguing topic by importing some essential libraries.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
```

## NLP - The Big Picture

At the core of NLP lies the objective of transforming raw human language data (either text or speech) into more structured and meaningful information. This is achieved through several NLP techniques. Let's delve into the two of the fundamental techniques used in NLP - Tokenization and Bag of words.

### 1. Tokenization

Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, where sentences are broken down or "tokenized" into individual words or tokens. Python's Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library offers an easy way to tokenize sentences.

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

sentence = "Natural Language Processing is fascinating."
tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
print(tokens)
```

Output:

```python
['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'fascinating', '.']
```

As we can see, every word and punctuation in the sentence is a separate token.

### 2. Bag of Words

Bag of Words (BoWs) is a technique used to encode textual information for use in machine learning. It involves tokenizing sentences, counting the occurrence of each token, and creating a vocabulary from it. We'll illustrate BoWs with an example using skLearn's CountVectorizer.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = [
    'Natural Language Processing is fascinating.',
    'I love exploring new concepts in Machine Learning.',
    'Python is my favorite programming language.'
]

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```

Output:

```python
['concepts', 'exploring', 'favorite', 'fascinating', 'in', 'is', 'language', 'learning', 'love', 'machine', 'my', 'natural', 'new', 'processing', 'programming', 'python']
[[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]
```

We can see that the BoW model has represented the sentences as vectors based on word occurrences.

## Conclusion

Natural Language Processing offers a new paradigm of communication between humans and machines. Its impact is evident across various sectors, from customer service automation to healthcare, entertainment, and digital marketing. By making machines understand human language and not code, NLP brings technology closer to a broader user base, breaking linguistic barriers.

And this is just the start! The fascinating world of NLP extends beyond tokenization and bag of words, into complex territory such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more. Hopefully, this introduction whets your appetite for exploring more about how machines read and understand our language.        

This comprehensive divulgence into NLP underscores the rapid strides AI is making towards simulating human intelligence. With further advancements, we can only wax lyrical about the yet unexplored possibilities that the confluence of language and AI has in store.

Making our machines understand us better, one word at a time. That's the promise of Natural Language Processing!
