# The Ins and Outs of GPU-accelerated Data Science

The use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has become increasingly prevalent in the field of Data Science due to their capability to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This article explores the concept of GPU-accelerated Data Science, its benefits, real-world applications and how we can leverage GPU power using Python libraries such as CuDF, CuPy and TensorFlow.

## Introduction

In traditional computers, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) has been the core of processing power. However, as data grows in complexity and size, the capabilities of the CPU can be significantly outpaced.

GPUs, originally designed and used for rendering high-quality graphics, have been found to be highly efficient for computational tasks involving large datasets. Their architecture allows for parallel processing units to handle thousands of threads simultaneously, making them ideal for the heavy compute tasks typically seen in machine learning and data science workloads.

## Why GPU-accelerated Data Science?

The main benefit of using GPUs in data science is the significant boost in processing speed. A task that may take hours to compute on CPUs could potentially be processed in minutes when parallelized on a GPU. 

```python
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp
import time

size = 100000000

# Create a large array on CPU
cpu_arr = np.random.normal(size=size)
start_time = time.time()
mean_cpu = np.mean(cpu_arr)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Mean computed on CPU: {mean_cpu}")
print(f"Time taken on CPU: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

# Now compute on GPU
gpu_arr = cp.asarray(cpu_arr)
start_time = time.time()
mean_gpu = cp.mean(gpu_arr).get()  # `get()` transfers result back to CPU
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Mean computed on GPU: {mean_gpu}")
print(f"Time taken on GPU: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

The output might look something like this depending on your specific hardware:

```
Mean computed on CPU: -0.0023123123123
Time taken on CPU: 0.7587790489196777 seconds
Mean computed on GPU: -0.0023123123123
Time taken on GPU: 0.23472881317138672 seconds
```

As you can see from the above example, there's a considerable speed gain when computation is accelerated with GPUs.

## Working with GPU-Accelerated Libraries

Several Python libraries allow us to use the processing power of GPUs. For instance, TensorFlow, a popular machine learning library, permits its models to run on GPUs. This can hasten the model training process significantly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check GPU availability
print("GPU is", "available" if tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices("GPU") else "NOT AVAILABLE")
```

Here's a simple example of a deep learning model that can be trained on your GPU with TensorFlow.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load MNIST dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess dataset
train_images = (train_images / 255) - 0.5
test_images = (test_images / 255) - 0.5
train_images = train_images.reshape((-1, 784))
test_images = test_images.reshape((-1, 784))

# Build the model
model = Sequential([
  Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax'),
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(
  train_images,
  to_categorical(train_labels),
  epochs=5,
  batch_size=32,
)
```

## Conclusion

GPU-accelerated data science has significant potential to improve the efficiency and performance of machine learning models and data processing tasks. Python libraries such as CuPy, CuDF, and TensorFlow offer powerful tools that enable users to tap into this potential effectively. 

Through understanding and implementing GPU-accelerated techniques, data scientists can handle larger datasets, build complex models, and expedite the iteration process. Despite this, it's critical to review the cost-effectiveness, as GPUs may not always be the most affordable solution, mainly when dealing with smaller datasets or less complex tasks.
