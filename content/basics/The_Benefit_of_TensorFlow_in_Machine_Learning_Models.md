# The Benefit of TensorFlow in Machine Learning Models

In the vast world of technology, TensorFlow has been making waves in the field of Machine Learning, revolutionizing the way we use and understand data. In this article, we explore what TensorFlow is, why it is beneficial, and how to use it in creating Machine Learning models.

## What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow, developed by the Google Brain team for internal use, was open sourced in November 2015 under the Apache 2.0 license. It is a powerful library for numerical computation, specifically well-suited for Machine Learning and Neural Network models. TensorFlow enables developers to create dataflow graphs- structures that describe how data moves through a graph, or a series of processing nodes.

## Why TensorFlow?

Why, you ask? Let's dive into the key benefits:

1. **Flexibility**: TensorFlow operates on a system of nodes and can function on multiple platforms: CPUs, GPUs and even mobile platforms.

2. **Versatility**: TensorFlow can be used for both research and application and is compatible with multiple languages like Python, Javascript, C++, etc.

3. **Portability**: Every part of the TensorFlow model is portable - this can range from machine to the browser.

4. **Collaboration**: Through TensorBoard, TensorFlow allows effective visualization of the machine learning models which makes debugging and optimization easier.

## TensorFlow in Action - A Working Example

To put pen to paper, let's create a basic TensorFlow program using Python. The example will create a simple linear model. First, be sure you have TensorFlow installed, if not install it via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Just for clarity, this article assumes that you have basic Python knowledge and familiarity with Machine Learning. 

Let's begin with importing and printing our TensorFlow version:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print(tf.__version__)
```

_Ouput:_ 

```bash
2.x.x  # Your TensorFlow version
```

Now, let's define our variables and constants:

```python
# Defining a TensorFlow Constant
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')

# Initializing a TensorFlow Session
with tf.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(hello))
```

_Ouput:_ 

```bash
Hello, TensorFlow!
```

From there onwards, we can start creating a simple linear model. Let's say we have a relationship y = 5x - 3, and we take some arbitrary data:

```python
# Defining the relationship y = 5x - 3
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
y = 5*x - 3

# Initializing a TensorFlow Session
with tf.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]}))
```

_Output:_

```bash
[[ 2.  7.]
 [12. 17.]]
```

Here, we've used TensorFlow to define a simple algebraic function and used a session to execute it.

## Conclusion

TensorFlow, through its flexibility, scalability, and robustness, has become a go-to framework for machine learning investigations and applications. Its capabilities and ongoing support from a large community of users, as well as its role in driving forward the field of machine learning, make it an enticing choice for both newcomers and experienced developers. While mastering TensorFlow might require time and effort, the doors it can open make the journey worthwhile! 

With the continuously evolving technological world and the ever-growing need for effective data analysis and prediction models, TensorFlow provides a sturdy, versatile platform. 

Remember, "The best way to predict your future is to create it." So, start exploring TensorFlow and dive into the world of Machine Learning - Happy Learning!
