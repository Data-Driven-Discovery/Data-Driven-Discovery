# Guide to Excel Automation using Python

Businesses often rely on Excel to handle vast amounts of data, from sales data analysis to financial forecasting. However, manually processing this data is often tedious and time-consuming. Python, a versatile programming language widely-known for its ease-of-use and broad ecosystem of data analyst tools, can be applied to automate tasks involving Excel datasets. This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to automate Excel tasks using Python.

## Introduction

Python is a popular language among data analysts because of its breadth of libraries for data manipulation. Pandas, openpyxl, and xlwings are a few renowned libraries for Excel automation using Python. In this guide, we will focus on openpyxl and pandas libraries.

## Requirements

To complete this guide, you'll need Python 3.7+ and pip installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install openpyxl and pandas libraries. You can install them with pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl pandas
```

## Reading an Excel File

Pandas can be used to read Excel files. To read an Excel file:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel("sales_data.xlsx")
print(df.head())
```

## Automating Calculations

Suppose you have a spreadsheet of sales data and you want to add a column indicating the total sales (Quantity * Price per item). You'd do this:

```python
df['Total Sales'] = df['Quantity'] * df['Price per item']
```

## Writing to an Excel File

Once we have manipulated the data, we can write it back to an Excel file. 

```python
df.to_excel("sales_data.xlsx", index=False) # write data to excel
```

You should see a new column titled 'Total Sales' in your Excel file.

## Using Openpyxl

While pandas is powerful for manipulating data, `openpyxl` library allows you more control over Excel files.

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

wb = load_workbook('sales_data.xlsx') # load workbook
ws = wb.active  # get active sheet

# assign value to cell
ws['A1'] = 'Hello'
ws['B1'] = 'World'

wb.save('sales_data.xlsx')  # save workbook
```

The Excel file now has 'Hello' and 'World' on cells A1 and B1, respectively.

Openpyxl allows you to access not just cell values, but properties like font, fill, border, and so on.

```python
from openpyxl.styles import Font

# change cell A1 font to bold
ws['A1'].font = Font(bold=True)

wb.save('sales_data.xlsx')
```

Now, 'Hello' on cell A1 is bold.

## Summary

Automating Excel tasks using Python tools can save significant amounts of time and reduce chances of human-made errors. Python's flexibility and rich ecosystem of data analytics libraries make it an ideal language for these tasks.

Choosing between pandas and openpyxl depends on your use case. For complex data manipulation tasks, pandas is a better choice due to its powerful data processing functions. On the other hand, for more direct Spreadsheet manipulations (like changing font styles, adding sheets, etc.), openpyxl is your best bet.

Learning to automate Excel with Python will free up your time to focus on other important tasks. It is a critical skill for data professionals and one that will undoubtedly become more important in the years ahead.

Python has a lot more to offer when it comes to Excel automation and data manipulation. Keep exploring and experimenting.
