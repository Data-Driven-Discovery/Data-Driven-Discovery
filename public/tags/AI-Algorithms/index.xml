      <description>Advanced Optimization Techniques for Machine Learning: Beyond Gradient Descent Optimizing machine learning models is an art and science, drawing on a rich body of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. While gradient descent and its variants like Adam and RMSprop are popular and widely used, the landscape of optimization techniques extends far beyond these methods. This article explores advanced optimization techniques that can speed up convergence, overcome the limitations of standard gradient-based methods, and optimize models that are not well-suited to gradient descent.</description>
