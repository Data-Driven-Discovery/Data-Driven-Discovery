      <description>Creating User-Friendly Visualizations with Tableau Data visualization plays an essential role in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering. It not only helps in understanding patterns, trends, or insights but also makes it easier to illustrate the story behind the numbers. In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore the role of Tableau, a widely-used data visualization tool, in creating user-friendly and interactive visualizations.
Note: Though this guide talks about Tableau, it does not include any Python or Bash code snippets since Tableau itself is a standalone tool for visualizing data.</description>
