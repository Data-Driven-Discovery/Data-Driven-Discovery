      <description>Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Environments: Overcoming Drift and Shift In the dynamic world of Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning (RL) stands out for its ability to make decisions and learn from them in real-time. However, when deploying RL models in real-world scenarios, one of the significant challenges is dealing with non-stationary environments. These are settings where the underlying data distribution changes over time, often referred to as concept drift or shift, posing a significant hurdle for maintaining the performance of RL models.</description>
