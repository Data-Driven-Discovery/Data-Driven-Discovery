      <description>Mastering Graph Neural Networks: From Theory to Cutting-Edge Applications Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized how we think about processing structured data. From social network analyses to molecular structure prediction, GNNs offer a powerful tool for researchers and engineers alike. This article aims to demystify GNNs, offering both an introduction for beginners and advanced insights for more experienced practitioners. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll not only grasp GNN concepts but also be equipped with the knowledge to implement cutting-edge GNN applications.</description>
